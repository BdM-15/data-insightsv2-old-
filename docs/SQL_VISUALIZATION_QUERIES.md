# SQL Visualization Queries Reference

Purpose: Central catalog of SQL queries powering frontend visualizations and analytical components. Each entry lists: (1) Visualization / Use Case, (2) Query (canonical form with parameter tokens), (3) Source Script & Function / Line Context, (4) Key Dimensions & Metrics, (5) Notes for LLM fine-tuning (what the query semantically represents).

Parameter Token Conventions:

- :naics_code, :start_date, :end_date, :agency, :contractor, :psc, :limit, :n, :top_n, :months_ahead, :suitability_percentage
- Where original code performs string interpolation for conditional clauses (e.g., 60â€‘month toggle), canonicalize to parameterized WHERE fragments shown below.

## 3. Indexing / Embedding Support (For Contextual Retrieval)

Although not direct visualizations, these queries feed semantic features used by UI search / future vector search.

### 3.1 Embedding Source Rows (Prime)

File: `data_processing/4_vectorize_semantic_description.py`

```sql
SELECT contract_transaction_unique_key, semantic_description
FROM s3_processed.usaspending_prime_awards
WHERE semantic_description IS NOT NULL AND semantic_description <> ''
  AND semantic_vector IS NULL
ORDER BY contract_transaction_unique_key
LIMIT :batch_size;
```

### 3.2 Embedding Source Rows (Subawards)

```sql
SELECT subaward_unique_key, semantic_description
FROM s3_processed.usaspending_subawards
WHERE semantic_description IS NOT NULL AND semantic_description <> ''
  AND semantic_vector IS NULL
ORDER BY subaward_unique_key
LIMIT :batch_size;
```

---

## 4. Filter Metadata & System Introspection

Representative queries used for populating dropdown filters and validating objects.

### 4.1 Distinct NAICS Codes Fallback

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT naics_code
FROM s3_processed.usaspending_prime_awards
WHERE naics_code IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY naics_code;
```

### 4.2 Existence Checks (Example)

```sql
SELECT EXISTS(
  SELECT 1 FROM information_schema.tables
  WHERE table_schema = 's3_processed' AND table_name = 'usaspending_prime_awards'
);
```

---

## 5. Fine-Tuning Guidance Mapping

For each visualization query above, treat the primary GROUP BY dimensions as categorical context tokens and aggregate metrics (SUM / COUNT / AVG derived) as numeric factual anchors. Generation tasks can:

- Form comparative statements (e.g., Top NAICS vs others) using ordered results.
- Derive ratios (award_count share, market_share) not explicitly queried but computable.
- Combine time-series (quarterly trends) with projection outputs to explain growth trajectories.

---

## 6. Change Log

- Initial extraction (2025-08-15): Captured capability stance, strategic dashboard, competition, vehicle, geographic, projection, expiring contracts, and embedding feeder queries.
