This code applies to the budgetary resources, obligations incurred, unobligated and obligated balances, and outlays that result from these appropriations.\n\n\nAs established in Memorandum M-18-08,  the domain value set for DEFC is a single letter from ‘A’ to ‘Z’. The default domain value for all funding without disaster or emergency designation is ‘Q’. OMB assigns a new DEFC domain value from the set to each enacted appropriation with disaster or emergency funding. The corresponding domain title for each DEFC domain value identifies the associated public law number(s) and whether the funding is disaster or emergency.\n\n\nMemorandum M-20-21 amended the above to allow agencies to use DEFC to meet reporting requirements for COVID-19 supplemental funding, which required tracking of funds not designated as emergency.\n\n\nAgencies use the following DEFC domain values and titles for COVID-19 supplemental funding:\n\n- **DEFC ‘L’**  Public Law 116-123, designated as emergency\n- **DEFC ‘M’**  Public Law 116-127, designated as emergency\n- **DEFC ‘N’**  Public Law 116-136, designated as emergency\n- **DEFC ‘O’**  Public Law 116-136, Public Law 116-139, and Public Law 116-260, not designated as emergency\n- **DEFC ‘P’**  Public Law 116-139, designated as emergency\n- **DEFC ‘U’**  Public Law 116-260, designated as emergency\n- **DEFC ‘V’**  Public Law 117-2, American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, not designated as emergency\n\n\nNote that the National Interest Action (NIA) code is also used to track COVID-19 spending. However, it only applies to procurement actions (i.e., contracts) and is not necessarily tied to COVID-19 supplemental appropriations. Thus, awards with the COVID-19 NIA value may not have a COVID-19 DEFC value, and vice versa.",

The finalized DAIMS first published in April 2016. Since then, Treasury has periodically published updates to reflect the inclusion of legislation and policies that go beyond the DATA Act. \n\nIn November 2023, DAIMS was rebranded as the GSDM to reflect the inclusion of new legislation and policies.

Subsidy cost is computed as a percentage of the loan value and does not include administrative costs.\n\nWhile the award amount for a grant or contract is the amount that the recipient gets, for a loan, the award amount is the subsidy cost. This is because the subsidy cost is the actual cost to the government (estimated). Loan Subsidy Cost has a direct budgetary impact and is factored into obligations and outlays when it is positive. Subsidy costs can be positive (indicating that the government is likely to lose money on the loan) or negative (indicating that the government is likely to make money on the loan). A positive Loan Subsidy Cost is usually smaller than the corresponding Face Value, but in certain edge cases it can be over 100% of the face value if the entire loan is written off and the government paid fees to a bank to issue the loan (which are also included in the subsidy cost).

It is displayed as a fiscal year (e.g., “FY 2020” or “FY20” for fiscal year 2020, covering October 2019 through September 2020) followed by a month (e.g., “P01” for October, which is the first month of the fiscal year) or quarter (e.g., “Q1” for the first quarter of the fiscal year, covering October through December). For example, “FY19 P10” indicates a submission whose data covers the period of July 2019.\n\nStarting with the June 2020 reporting period, most federal agencies began submitting their account data (Files A, B, and C) to the Treasury DATA Act Broker on a monthly basis rather than on the previous quarterly schedule. As of October 2021 (FY22 Q1), all agencies are required to report on a monthly basis. More information about the agency account data reporting policy is found in OMB’s Memorandum M-20-21 (Appendix A, Section III).",
